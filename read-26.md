# Application Fundamentals:

Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK, an Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix. One APK file contains all the contents of an Android app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.

***Each Android app lives in its own security sandbox, protected by the following Android security features:***

* The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.
By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). 
* The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.
* Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app's code runs in isolation from other apps.
* By default, every app runs in its own Linux process. The Android system starts the process when any of the app's components need to be executed, and then shuts down the process when it's no longer needed or when the system must recover memory for other apps.


The Android system implements the principle of least privilege. That is, each app, by default, has access only to the components that it requires to do its work and no more. This creates a very secure environment in which an app cannot access parts of the system for which it is not given permission. However, there are ways for an app to share data with other apps and for an app to access system services:

* It's possible to arrange for two apps to share the same Linux user ID, in which case they are able to access each other's files. To conserve system resources, apps with the same user ID can also arrange to run in the same Linux process and share the same VM.The apps must also be signed with the same certificate.
* An app can request permission to access device data such as the device's location, camera, and Bluetooth connection. The user has to explicitly grant these permissions.


## App components

App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app. Some components depend on others.

**There are four different types of app components:**

* Activities
* Services
* Broadcast receivers
* Content providers
* Each type serves a distinct purpose and has a distinct lifecycle that defines how the component is created and destroyed. The - following sections describe the four types of app components.

### Activities:

An activity facilitates the following key interactions between system and app:

* Keeping track of what the user currently cares about (what is on screen) to ensure that the system keeps running the process that is hosting the activity.
* Knowing that previously used processes contain things the user may return to (stopped activities), and thus more highly prioritize keeping those processes around.
* Helping the app handle having its process killed so the user can return to activities with their previous state restored.
* Providing a way for apps to implement user flows between each other, and for the system to coordinate these flows.

### Services

A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons. It is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes. A service does not provide a user interface.

### Broadcast receivers

A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. Because broadcast receivers are another well-defined entry into the app, the system can deliver broadcasts even to apps that aren't currently running.

### Content providers

A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access. Through the content provider, other apps can query or modify the data if the content provider allows it. 

Content providers are also useful for reading and writing data that is private to your app and not shared.


***There are separate methods for activating each type of component:***

* You can start an activity or give it something new to do by passing an Intent to `startActivity()` or `startActivityForResult()` (when you want the activity to **return** a result).
* With Android 5.0 (API level 21) and later, you can use the JobScheduler class to schedule actions. For earlier Android versions, you can start a service (or give new instructions to an ongoing service) by passing an Intent to `startService()`. You can bind to the service by passing an Intent to `bindService()`.
* You can initiate a broadcast by passing an Intent to methods such as `sendBroadcast()`, `sendOrderedBroadcast()`, or `sendStickyBroadcast()`.
* You can perform a query to a content provider by calling `query()` on a `ContentResolver`.

## The manifest file

Before the Android system can start an app component, the system must know that the component exists by reading the app's manifest file, AndroidManifest.xml. Your app must declare all its components in this file, which must be at the root of the app project directory.

***The manifest does a number of things in addition to declaring the app's components, such as the following:***

* Identifies any user permissions the app requires, such as Internet access or read-access to the user's contacts.
* Declares the minimum API Level required by the app, based on which APIs the app uses.
* Declares hardware and software features used or required by the app, such as a camera, bluetooth services, or a multitouch screen.
* Declares API libraries the app needs to be linked against (other than the Android framework APIs), such as the Google Maps library.
