## Choose a monetization model for your app

* ### Sell goods or services through your app

***Sell digital goods or services with Google Play's billing system***

Developers who distribute their app through Google Play are required to use Google Play's billing system to sell in-app content. Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:

* Virtual game products
* App functionality or content
* Subscription services
* Cloud software products

***Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay***

Use Google Pay to sell physical goods or services that are used or delivered outside of your app. Google Pay provides your customers a faster, safer way to pay online, both in apps and wherever contactless payments are accepted. Accepting Google Pay speeds up your checkout process, as users won't need to enter their payment details each time or when they first download your app.

Products where we recommend developers use Google Pay include the following:

* Retail merchandise,
* Physical services,
* One-time membership fees or recurring dues
* Electronic bill payment


***Other app monetization options***

* Advertising

* Paid apps

### Best practices for setting your initial monetization strategy

* Research other apps in your category
* Think about how your app will be used
* Make use of natural extensions
* Consider your cost structures: If you have significant recurring content costs, consider using subscriptions. Use a free trial period to encourage uptake.
* Consider your audience
* Consider local factors when setting prices
